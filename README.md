Absolutely right! The README.md should be updated to reflect the successful S5 portal integration and provide clear instructions for testing. Here's an updated version:

## Updated README.md

# Enhanced S5.js SDK

An enhanced JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for the S5 decentralized storage network, featuring a simple path-based API for file and directory operations.

## Features

- üöÄ **Path-based API**: Simple `get()`, `put()`, `delete()`, `list()` operations
- üìÅ **Directory Support**: Full directory tree management with recursive operations
- üîÑ **Cursor Pagination**: Efficient handling of large directories
- üîê **Built-in Encryption**: Automatic encryption for private data
- üì¶ **CBOR Serialization**: Deterministic encoding for cross-platform compatibility
- üåê **Browser & Node.js**: Works in both environments
- üóÇÔ∏è **HAMT Sharding**: Automatic directory sharding for millions of entries
- üö∂ **Directory Walker**: Recursive traversal with filters and resumable cursors
- üìã **Batch Operations**: High-level copy/delete operations with progress tracking
- ‚úÖ **Real S5 Portal Integration**: Fully tested with s5.vup.cx portal

## Installation

The enhanced path-based API features are currently in development as part of a Sia Foundation grant project.

**For production use:**

```bash
npm install @s5-dev/s5js
```
````

**To try the enhanced features:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/julesl23/s5.js
cd s5.js

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Run tests with real S5 portal
npm test
```

**Status**: These features are pending review and have not been merged into the main S5.js repository.

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { S5 } from "./dist/src/index.js";

// Create S5 instance and connect to real S5 portal
const s5 = await S5.create({
  initialPeers: [
    "wss://z2DWuPbL5pweybXnEB618pMnV58ECj2VPDNfVGm3tFqBvjF@s5.ninja/s5/p2p",
  ],
});

// Generate or use a seed phrase
const seedPhrase = "your twelve word seed phrase goes here";
await s5.recoverIdentityFromSeedPhrase(seedPhrase);

// Register on S5 portal (s5.vup.cx supports the new API)
await s5.registerOnNewPortal("https://s5.vup.cx");

// Initialize filesystem (creates home and archive directories)
await s5.fs.ensureIdentityInitialized();

// Store data
await s5.fs.put("home/documents/hello.txt", "Hello, S5!");

// Retrieve data
const content = await s5.fs.get("home/documents/hello.txt");
console.log(content); // "Hello, S5!"

// List directory contents
for await (const item of s5.fs.list("home/documents")) {
  console.log(`${item.type}: ${item.name}`);
}
```

## Testing with Real S5 Portal

The enhanced S5.js has been successfully integrated with real S5 portal infrastructure. To test:

### 1. Fresh Identity Test (Recommended)

This test creates a new identity and verifies all functionality:

```bash
node tests/test-fresh-s5.js
```

Expected output: 100% success rate (9/9 tests passing)

### 2. Full Integration Test

Comprehensive test of all features:

```bash
node tests/test-s5-full-integration.js
```

### 3. Direct Portal API Test

Tests direct portal communication:

```bash
node tests/test-portal-direct.js
```

### Important Notes

- **Use Fresh Identities**: The new deterministic key derivation system requires fresh identities. Old accounts created with the previous system won't work.
- **Portal URL**: Use `https://s5.vup.cx` which has the updated API. Other portals may not have the required updates.
- **Path Requirements**: All paths must start with either `home/` or `archive/`

## Performance Benchmarks

The enhanced S5.js includes comprehensive performance benchmarks to verify HAMT efficiency and scaling behaviour.

### Running Benchmarks

#### Local Mock Benchmarks (Fast)

Test HAMT performance with mock S5 API:

```bash
# Basic HAMT verification
node tests/test-hamt-local-simple.js

# Comprehensive scaling test (up to 100K entries)
node tests/test-hamt-mock-comprehensive.js
```

#### Real Portal Benchmarks (Network)

Test with actual S5 portal (requires internet connection):

```bash
# Minimal real portal test
node tests/test-hamt-real-minimal.js

# HAMT activation threshold test
node tests/test-hamt-activation-real.js

# Full portal performance analysis
node tests/test-hamt-real-portal.js
```

### Benchmark Results

See [BENCHMARKS.md](./docs/BENCHMARKS.md) for detailed performance analysis showing:
- HAMT activation at exactly 1000 entries
- O(log n) scaling verified up to 100K+ entries
- ~800ms per operation on real S5 network
- Memory usage of ~650 bytes per entry

For production deployments, these benchmarks confirm the implementation is ready for large-scale directory operations.

- [Milestones](./docs/MILESTONES.md) - Grant milestone tracking

## Development

This is an enhanced version of s5.js being developed under an 8-month grant from the Sia Foundation. The project implements a new format using:

- **New Format**: CBOR serialization with DirV1 specification (replaces MessagePack)
- **Path-based API**: Simple file operations with familiar syntax
- **HAMT sharding**: Automatic directory sharding for efficient large directory support
- **Directory utilities**: Recursive operations with progress tracking and error handling
- **Deterministic Key Derivation**: Subdirectory keys derived from parent keys
- **Real Portal Integration**: Successfully tested with s5.vup.cx

**Note**: This is a clean implementation that does NOT maintain backward compatibility with old S5 data formats.

### Building

```bash
npm run build     # Compile TypeScript
npm run dev       # Watch mode
npm run test      # Run tests
```

### Project Status

- ‚úÖ Month 1: Project Setup - Complete
- ‚úÖ Month 2: Path Helpers v0.1 - Complete
- ‚úÖ Month 3: Path-cascade Optimization & HAMT - Complete
- ‚úÖ Month 4: Directory Utilities - Complete
- ‚úÖ **S5 Portal Integration** - Complete (100% test success rate)
- üöß Month 5: Media Processing (Part 1) - In Progress
- ‚è≥ Months 6-8: Advanced features pending

See [MILESTONES.md](./docs/MILESTONES.md) for detailed progress.

## Testing & Integration

- For S5 portal testing, see the test files mentioned above
- For integration testing with external services, see [test-server-README.md](./tests/test-server-README.md)

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid base length" errors

- Solution: Use a fresh seed phrase. Old accounts have incompatible key structures.

### Directory not found errors

- Solution: Ensure you call `ensureIdentityInitialized()` after portal registration
- All paths must start with `home/` or `archive/`

### Portal connection issues

- Use `https://s5.vup.cx` which has the updated API
- Ensure you have Node.js v20+ for proper crypto support
